I finally got around to putting this website together, hosted by [GitHub](https://github.com/).

My interests are computer programming and music making, in particular string bass instruments.

Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and I can use Markdown to author my posts.
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
