I am a heavy user of Visual Studio, from version 6 to 2013, both at work and for hobby projects.

The latest version 2015 has opened up to multi platform, in particular mobile.

I will be migrating my Windows-only C# projects to portable C# and to web technologies, starting with my Contrebasse project.
